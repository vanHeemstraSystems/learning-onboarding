# 200 - Step 2: Identify Stakeholder

After laying out your objectives for the first 90 days, the next step is to identify the stakeholders you should meet and interview. The conversations you have as a new employee may be an extension of what you learned during the interview process or provide completely new and highly valuable information.

Identify with your manager who you will be interacting with on a regular basis in your new role and who else within the company you should connect with to gain their insights or to prepare for future collaboration. Then craft your questions for these conversations using the [90-Day Interview Guide. (pdf)](https://www.alumni.hbs.edu/alumni/Documents/careers/90-Day%20Interview%20Questionnaire_Template.pdf)

Sample questions include:

- What is our company’s greatest strength(s)?
- What’s the one thing we’re not doing today to accelerate growth (of revenue, customers, product, service, etc.) but should?
- What would need to happen for the organization to seize the potential of these opportunities?
- What are the biggest challenges the organization is facing (or will face) in the near future?
