# 100 - Step 1: Detail What, Why, and How

**Resources**:
- [Template: 90-Day Action Plan Formation_Template.xlsx](../../../templates/90-Day%20Action%20Plan%20Formation_Template.xlsx)

Step 1 in the “slow down to go fast” five-step process is to detail the first 90 days by communicating openly with your manager about:

- What you plan to do to learn your new role and contribute
- Why you are structuring your approach in this way
- How you will execute this plan to make progress

To guide this conversation and keep you focused, break out your first 90 days into a three-segment action plan [like the one outlined here](https://www.alumni.hbs.edu/alumni/Documents/careers/90-Day%20Action%20Plan%20Formation_Template.xlsx). Segments one and two will be dedicated to accelerating your learning and beginning to contribute to the conversation. Segment three (days 61 through 90) will be further detailed as you meet stakeholders and conduct interviews.

Note the importance of quantifying output of each segment and scheduling check ins to manage expectations and maintain open lines of communication.

**TIP**:
To be organized, store the */templates/[Onboarding.xlsx](../../../templates/Onboarding.xlsx)* file inside a directory like ```C:/USERNAME/Documents/Teams/Team IT 1 - FooBar Architecture/Flows/Onboarding/Onboarding.xlsx``` (where *FooBar* is replaced with the Agile Release Train name) and print each one of the sheets on a separate A4 sized landscaped white blank paper (Note: seal the paper with a plastic sheet heated to wrap it and prevent smudges or folds) which can be ring-bound in an ordner or clamped on a paper stand on the side of a monitor or laptop computer for easy access and clear visibility.
